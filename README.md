# Heart-Attack-Cases-in-India-Dashboard
An interactive healthcare analytics dashboard designed to analyze heart attack cases using patient demographics, lifestyle factors, and clinical indicators.

📌 Problem Statement

Heart attacks remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
Hospitals and health analysts often struggle to identify risk patterns across age, gender, region, lifestyle, and medical history using raw patient data.

The challenge is to transform complex clinical datasets into clear, actionable insights that support prevention, early diagnosis, and policy decisions.

💡 Solution Overview

This project delivers a visual analytics dashboard that summarizes heart attack cases using key health metrics and categorical risk factors.

The dashboard enables users to:

Compare affected vs non-affected patients

Analyze risk across age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar

Understand lifestyle impacts such as exercise and smoking

Identify regional and gender-based patterns

📊 Key KPIs

Total Patients: 2000

Affected Patients: 603

Average Age: 60.06

Average Systolic BP: 149.80

Average Diastolic BP: 89

Average Cholesterol Level: 199.77

Average Blood Sugar: 134

🧠 Insights from Dashboard
🔹 Demographic Analysis

Females (51.5%) show slightly higher heart attack cases than males

Majority of cases occur in the 60+ age group

🔹 Lifestyle Factors

Low exercise level patients show the highest heart attack count

Smoking significantly increases risk compared to non-smokers

🔹 Regional Distribution

Heart attack cases are fairly distributed across regions

North and East regions show marginally higher case counts

🔹 Clinical Indicators

Patients with abnormal ECG results show higher risk

Previous heart issues strongly correlate with new heart attacks
